This is a very simple design of an LC3 using VHDL. It has the following components:
1) Registers with 16b width.
2) PC.
3) MUX.
4) gates.
5) 1KB memory with 16b words.
6) An array of 8 registers.
7) A simple ALU, that can perform AND, SUM and NOT operations.
8) An FSM with 33 states defined, based on the testbench.
